📚 Literature Summarizer — AI-Powered PDF Analysis App

A production-ready, local AI application that enables users to upload academic or technical PDF documents, generate concise summaries, and ask semantic questions over the document content.

Built with LangChain, FAISS, Ollama, and Streamlit, this project demonstrates end-to-end LLM application development — from document ingestion and embeddings to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and UI deployment.

🚀 Project Highlights

- End-to-end RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline
- Fully local LLM inference (no external LLM APIs)
- Scalable document chunking and vector indexing
- Real-time semantic question answering
- Clean, reproducible Python environment design
- Production-oriented dependency and model management
